# Random-Graphs-ErdosRenyi-C-

This project was done as part of an Algorithms course.
It deals with the study of 3 attributes in graphs according to the Erdös–Renyi model.
In this project I create 15,000 random graphs for 1,000 nodes I research 3 properties - each attribute on 5000 generated graphs - formed according to 10 different probability values that are very close to threshold
